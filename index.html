      I'm a Software Development student and I'm very happy to learn more about Web Programming.

      Brazil is a tropical country. We have green pastures and wonderful landscapes.
      We are known for our warm hearts and loving culture.
      Some famous places to visit are the "Cristo Redentor" and our beaches.
      But in my opinion, the best place to visit is the temple!
